    <section id="profile">
        <p>An accomplished <strong>Javascript Engineer</strong> with a <strong>14 year</strong> history fulfilling Developer, Architect and leadership roles.</p>
        <p>A <strong>direct</strong> communicator with a <strong>pragmatic</strong> "useful first, elegant later" approach to product development. I specialise in <strong>modern server, web, social</strong> and <strong>mobile applications</strong> built on a <strong>full Javascript stack</strong> (<strong>Node.js, MongoDb, Redis</strong> etc.).</p>
        <p><strong>Business-focussed</strong> with experience under a diverse range of conditions, from agile start-ups experiencing wild growth (<a href="http://www.bet365.com">bet365.com</a>) to micro-managed, global manufacturers requiring traceability and precision (<a href="http://www.siemens.com">Siemens AG</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="productHistory">
    <h1>Product History</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Conceived, pitched and built a <strong>Broadcast Automation</strong> product for Immedia Plc used by <strong>High Street retail and banking</strong> chains to automate the broadcast of branded, "as live", <strong>in-store radio</strong> stations. Clients receive an <strong>Android</strong> device pre-loaded with software and content (music, playlists, presenter reads, branders and commercials) which they plug in and play. The client may accept the station as-is or make live adjustments (schedule, aesthetic, energy level) to suit the atmosphere in-store. New content is pushed to each device overnight. Stations are governed at store, region or estate level. Proved a hit with early adopters with <strong>thousands of sign-ups</strong>.</li>
        <li>Part of the five-man team development behind the <strong>launch of <a href="http://www.bet365.com">Bet365.com</a></strong>. Principally known for the specialised, <strong>Sportsbook CMS in production use for over a decade</strong> (used internally by management, translators and bookmakers to stock bet365 with structured, template-driven, multi-lingual content). Deployed an "Oddsfeed" Web Service giving 3rd parties controlled access to our data (an innovation, ten years ago). Hired as a junior, grew into the <strong>first choice for important work</strong>.</li>
        <li>Rebuilt an archaic, crumbling <strong>Industrial Gas Turbine Performance Analysis</strong> solution at <a href="http://www.siemens.com">Siemens</a>. An extremely complex and delicate project owing to a) the many stakeholders and distance between them, b) the scale and prohibitive costs involved (minimum Â£20k per integration test), c) the ancient equipment involved ('70s measurement instrumentation with obscure APIs), d) old languages to reverse engineer (Fortran, AS/400 CL), e) vast quantities of data to store etc.. There were many challenges and constraints but we got there, going with Oracle (high-volume, high-availability data management, reporting, XML DB), C#, ASP.NET and Matlab (mathematical analysis). Also built a <strong>Sharepoint</strong> solution for the department.</li>
        <li><strong>Lead Architect</strong> and Developer at Centrinet on a team building a shrink-wrapped product enabling the customer (typically a Data Centre) to extend their offering with <strong>on-demand, Platform As A Service</strong> (PAAS) capabilities (similar to Amazon EC2).</li> 
        <li>Contracted by Barbon Insurance Group to help integrate an external supplier's quotation product with in-house systems. However, <strong>UML specifications</strong> i produced shedding light on the proposed integration led to project cancellation and supplier prosecution! I was retained as <strong>Technical Architect and LAMP developer</strong>. Also built the company <strong>Sharepoint</strong> solution and mentored the team in areas like design, UML and version control.</li>
        <li>Led data management on the Jubilee Line Extension Project, one of the Government's high profile Millennium Projects. Produced the tools and systems to collect, organise and distribute Inspection data project-wide. Rapidly outgrew my initial "Technical Admin" role to earn a reputation for above-and-beyond inventiveness. On completion, my services were "passed" to London Underground then Transport for London.</li> 
        <li>Conceived and built the "Strategic Planning Database" used to plan and manage Engineering Works across the London Underground network.</li>
        <li>Delivered a similar database solution to help Transport for London organise the "London Bus Lanes Order" implementation of 2001.</li>
    </ul>

    <section id="currentWork">
    <h1>Current Work</h1>
    <p>I took time out to work on some <strong>open source</strong> products, all of which are <strong>100% Javascript WIP</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/75lb/veelo">Veelo</a>: perform a range of video library optimisations, e.g.: 
            <ul>
                <li>consolidate a mixture of formats to a single, modern video format which works everywhere (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC)</li>
                <li>create device-optimised encodes (e.g. iPhone, TV, Android etc)</li>
                <li>embed subtitles from external files</li>
                <li>split video files into chunks (e.g. 15 minute segments for upload to YouTube)</li>
                <li>merge video files</li>
                <li>create a "library preview" - a collage incorporating a clip from every video specified</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/75lb/nature">Nature</a> provides a base class (<code>Thing</code>) to enable more accurate classification of the things (<code>DatabaseConfig</code>, <code>VideoFileList</code>, <code>YoungMan</code>, <code>FlammableCar</code> etc.) in your world (function or app). These Things can be reused, subclassed or merged with other Things to create new hybrids. The <code>Thing</code> class, when subclassed/instantiated adds useful features to each object:
            <ul>
                <li>Fine-grained type and value validation per property</li>
                <li>Direct command line, environment, external file or object literal loading capability</li>
                <li>Merging and cloning</li>
                <li>property grouping and filtering</li>
                <li>methods for duck typing</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Got a thousand jobs to do? Get an execution plan with <a href="">Work</a>. Create one of more instances of <code>Job</code>, specifying the <code>name</code>, <code>command</code>, <code>arguments</code> and whether the job may run in <code>parallel</code> to others. Add each <code>Job</code> to a <code>Queue</code> for execution in the order provided. Each <code>Job</code> can have a sub-<code>Queue</code> to be executed <code>onSuccess</code>, <code>onProgress</code> or <code>onFailure</code>, each of which containing its own set of <code>Job</code> instances. And so the hierarchy grows! Work can also project a dashboard, providing real-time progress information on any standard Node.js <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html">Stream</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/75lb/temple">Temple of Mars</a>: a real-time, multi-player Facebook boxing prediction and scoring game for desktop and mobile. Despite having a solid user base, work has been postponed. Originally built on version 0.3.5 of <a href="http://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a>, a full-stack framework i was forced to abandon due to several fatal flaws. Rewrite planned. </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/75lb/handbrake-js">handbrake-js</a>: An npm distribution of <a href="https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/CLIGuide">HandbrakeCLI</a> for either command line or library use.</li>
        <li>And <a href="https://github.com/75lb?tab=repositories">more</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Although still heavily under development, around this portfolio you can find usage of Behaviour Driven Development, Continuous Integration, Design Patterns, ECMAScript 5 features, API design and documentation.</p>

    <p>I contribute to other projects when necessary, most notably <a href="http://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a> who kindly thanked me with a parcel of merchandise and t-shirts (which i won't be wearing in public any time soon!)</p>

        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Pragmatic - prototype, test the water, absorb feedback and validate demand <em>before</em> committing to a full build.</li>
            <li>Collaborative - not a fan of 'my project, my business' mentality.</li>
            <li>Methodical. <strong>Agile</strong> Unified Process or <strong>Scrum</strong> preferred. Don't like 'headless chicken'.</li>
            <li>Good architectural practice - MVC, loosely coupled (built to an interface), data source agnostic, cross-platform, standards-based.</li> 
            <li><strong>Mobile First</strong>. The desktop market is not dying but not growing, either. Smartphone and tablet growth is exponential.</li>
