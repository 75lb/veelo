Veelo
=====
Perform batch optimisations on your video library, e.g.

* consolidate a mixture of formats to a single, modern video format which works everywhere (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC).
* create device-specific encodes (e.g. iPhone, TV, Android etc)
* embed subtitles from external files
* split video into chunks (e.g. 15 minute segments for upload to YouTube)
* merge video files
* create a collage incorporating a clip from every video in your library

Works on __Windows__, __Linux__ and __Mac OSX__ as a command-line app or Node.js library.
