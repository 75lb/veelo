Veelo
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/75lb/veelo.png)](https://travis-ci.org/75lb/veelo)

Requiring multiple media players and plugins to play video is annoying. Video refusing to play on expensive, modern TVs and mobile devices even more so. Well, you could optimise your video library - consolidate from a mixture of legacy and proprietary formats to a single, modern format which works everywhere (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC).

Veelo, a command-line Video Library Optimisation tool built on top of the outstanding encoder [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr), was built for this task.

Works on __Windows__, __Linux__ and __Mac OSX__.
